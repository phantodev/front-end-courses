## FRONT-END COURSES

After years and more years of experience, I decided to organize all my knowledge here in my repository.

So all interested, here is a short list of my technical knowledge. What I have studied in these 20 years (Sorry, but i have a big list of depreacted softwares as well :-( I miss you Macromedia Flash)) of Front-End Develpment and what I still have to study.

Yes I know. My studies must be continued until the end of my life! :-)
