# GIT AND GIT HUB FOR DUMMIES - UDEMY - WILLIAM JUSTEN

William Justen is one of the best Brazilian teachers today. His famous Advanced React course is highlighted in the world and I can learn a little more about GIT commands from him in this excellent class.

## Scenes

✔️ - We need start our "history production" of my project - command: `git init`, then `git add .` or `git add filename.*`<br/>
✔️ - We need put a message in this point of the timeline - command: `git commit -am "here we write a message"`<br/>
✔️ - we need check some infos from my project. - command: `git log` and `git status`<br/>
✔️ - we need start new version project (new branch or new parallel universe). - command: `git branch name-of-new-branch` (We can't use white spaces, ok?) or `git checkout -B name-of-new-branch` (We gonna create a new branch and change to it at same time!)<br/>
✔️ - we need list all my branchs. - command: `git branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need change to another branch. - command: `git checkout name-of-the-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need merge one branch with another branch. - command: `git merge name-of-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need merge one branch with another branch in linear mode. - command: `git rebase name-of-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need delete some branch. - command: `git branch -D name-of-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need create my files in cloud first time (GITHUB, GITLAB or BITBUCKET). - command: `git remote add origin url-from-your-repository` (We need create our repository first on GITHUB)<br/>
✔️ - we need send my files to cloud. - command: `git push`<br/>
✔️ - we need get files (create a local clone) from cloud. - command: `git clone url-from-your-repository`<br/>
✔️ - we need update my local files from cloud. - command: `git pull`<br/>
✔️ - we need take some file at a point from timeline. - command `git checkout hash-tag -- file-name` (Using `git log` we can get the hash-tag)
✔️ - we need stash/store/save a draft from file to use later or in a moment that you need change to another branch quickly. - command: `git stash`<br/>
✔️ - we need return the code but we can loose our full code made. - command: `git revert`<br/>

## Creating ALIAS

`git config --global alias.s status` with this ALIAS to check a status for example i just need type in command `git s`

## Creating TAGS

`git tag` with this command i can create RELEASE TAGS on GITHUB. With this way i can create differents versions of my code using this TAGS. Example: v1.0, v1.1.

## Highlights

https://github.com/github/gitignore - In this link there are some templates to git ignore in some projects.

## Thanks
