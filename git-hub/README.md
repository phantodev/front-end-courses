# GIT AND GIT HUB

Practical course for basic to advanced GIT commands.

In this course we learn some forms of project organization patterns.

### Installing

We need download the installer. Simple right?

## Scenes

✔️ - We need start our "history production" of my project - command: `git init`, then `git add .` or `git add filename.*`<br/>
✔️ - We need put a message in this point of the timeline - command: `git commit -am "here we write a message"`<br/>
✔️ - we need check some infos from my project. - command: `git log` and `git status`<br/>
✔️ - we need start new version project (new branch or new parallel universe). - command: `git branch name-of-new-branch` (We can't use white spaces, ok?) or `git checkout -B name-of-new-branch` (We gonna create a new branch and change to it at same time!)<br/>
✔️ - we need list all my branchs. - command: `git branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need change to another branch. - command: `git checkout name-of-the-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need merge one branch with another branch. - command: `git merge name-of-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need delete some branch. - command: `git branch -D name-of-branch`<br/>
✔️ - we need create my files in cloud first time (GITHUB, GITLAB or BITBUCKET). - command: `git remote add origin url-from-your-repository` (We need create our repository first on GITHUB)<br/>
✔️ - we need send my files to cloud. - command: `git push`<br/>
✔️ - we need get files (create a local clone) from cloud. - command: `git clone url-from-your-repository`<br/>
✔️ - we need update my local files from cloud. - command: `git pull`<br/>
✔️ - we need take some file at a point from timeline. - command `git checkout hash-tag -- file-name` (Using `git log` we can get the hash-tag)
