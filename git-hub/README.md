## Scenes

✔️ - We need start our "history production" of my project - command: git init, then git add . or git add filename.
✔️ - We need put a message in this point of the timeline - command: git commit -m "here we write a message"
✔️ - we need check some infos from my project. - command: git log and git status
✔️ - we need start new version project (new branch or new parallel universe). - command: git branch name-of-new-branch (We can't use white spaces, ok?)
✔️ - we need list all my branchs. - command: git branch
✔️ - we need change to another branch. - command: git checkout name-of-the-branch
